## Why Does this Site have a Privacy Policy?

No matter whether I legally have to or not, I think it's the correct thing to do, especially given that the majority of small blogs and websites leverage tools and services provided by much larger and wealthier corporate entities that may have a commercial benefit or interest from providing (often free) services to the wider community.
